However, the developer is very happy to help if there are any questions or troubles. The preferred way of contact would be to open a GitHub issue.
GitHub is a free software collaboration platform. You can easily create an account there and then open an issue with your question or the problem which you have.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://www.cantara.app/get-help/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
