Cantara is an open source software which is used for managing and presenting hymns and songs in churches, small groups and more. It supports various input formats and can create beautiful presentation slides or export the presentation to various output formats (pictures, pptx, WhatsApp message and a lot more) so that they can be used for a variety of purposes.

Cantara is **user centered** and works out of the box, like this:

Cantara has the following advantages:

* **Very easy to use**: Accepts the most common input format (CCLI songselect lyrics file) and creats the presentation slides for an event in only a few seconds. The usage is very intuitive and user-friendly.
* **Good integration with other presentation software**: Cantara can export presentations to PPTX format and therefore integrates easily with other presentation software like LibreOffice Impress or MS Powerpoint. It can be included in a complex workflow like a church service or even an online streaming event via OBS.

* **Multi-Screen-Support**: Multi Screen is supported out of the box.
* **Customizable Design and good outlook**: The colors and fonts can be configured in the settings. In addition, you can set up a background picture and adjust it's brightness/transparency. The presentations look beautiful and are easy to read.
