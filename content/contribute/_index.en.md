Cantara is free Software and has been developed with a lot of patience and passion. If you like it, I would be grateful if you consider one of the things below. Thank you for using Cantara. It is my pleasure and honor!

## Give feedback, recommendations and bug reports

If you find any issues, have ideas or recommendations or want to report a bug, please [open an issue at the Cantara Github repository](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/issues). I work completely via Github on the project, so that would be the best way to go. If you have no Github account and don't want to create one, ask a friend to do it for you.

## Translate Cantara to an other language

Cantara is used by people all over the world. Over the time, some volunteers contributed translations to several languages. Take a look at the [translation section](translate/) to learn the current state of the art and ways how to support me in this matter.

## Recommend it

The more people use Cantara, the better the program can get! Feel free to recommend Cantara via your available channels. 

## Don't donate to me, but to someone else

Although I am still a "poor" student ðŸ˜ƒ, I am wealthy enough to not need any donations or financial support. However, there are a lot of people in the world who are currently really in need or suffering. If you like Cantara and you find that while using the software you have saved some money, please consider to support one of the non-profit-organisations below which I really appreciate and want to support:

* [OpenDoors](https://www.opendoors.de/): A Christian organization helping persecuted Christians all over the world.
* [Missioneswerk Werner Heukelbach](https://www.heukelbach.org/): A missionary organization for sharing the gospel in Germany.
* [Support Ukraine](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) by donating to NGOs, the Red Cross or the Ukrainian military and help the country to preserve its freedom and existence!

Thank you for your help!
