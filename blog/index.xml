Originally only designed for my personal purpose (having a simple song presentation program for church groups) it is now a widely used Open Source project. According to the snap store statistics (which is the only reliable one I have at the moment), Cantara is currently used by more then 120 individuals from 39 countries around the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
