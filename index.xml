When conducting our events, we liked to sing a few songs at the beginning. However the problem occurred that the available song books where not enough and the content was sometimes not matching with the songs which were wished. At that time I was looking for an available song presentation program and became disappointed quickly.</description></item><item><title>Translate</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/translate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 15:11:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/contribute/translate/</guid><description>Cantara can be easily translated to an other language. While doing so, you will help to spread the use of the software all over the world, so that also people who don&amp;rsquo;t speak English have access to Cantara.
How it works Cantara uses language files (*.mo-files) which contain the translated language strings in a binary language. This files can be created by using an editor like Poedit using the cantara.pot file as a template.</description></item><item><title>Install Cantara</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/install-cantara/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/install-cantara/</guid><description>Installing Cantara is quite simple if you are using Windows or Linux.

You will then see the welcome assistent which helps you to go through the configuration of Cantara. Here you should choose a song repository directory where you all the song lyrics files are stored. If you have none yet, you can create an empty new folder and select it as your song repository. The assistent will suggest you to add &amp;ldquo;Amazing Grace&amp;rdquo; as an example song which you can use to understand how the program works.</description></item><item><title>Meta Data</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/meta-data/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/meta-data/</guid><description>Cantara allows you to fetch and display meta data from the songs. Depending on the song format, Cantara will get the following meta data.
CCLI Songselect Following data will be collected from each CCLI songselect lyrics file:
author: The name(s) of all author(s) separated by a &amp;lsquo;|&amp;rsquo;. ccli-licensenumber: The number of the CCLI license which is dependent on the user account (not on the song) ccli-songnumber: The CCLI number on the song which is dependent on the song.</description></item><item><title>Where to get the songs</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/where-to-get-the-songs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 15:37:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/where-to-get-the-songs/</guid><description>Getting the songs might be one of the most important questions when using a song presentation software. Cantara supports two different song formats. One has the file ending .song and is very simple for it just contains the lyrics in the order as they should be presented. The other format is used by CCLI Songselect and has the file endings .txt or .ccli. CCLI is a commercial database where you can download a lot of Christian songs for the use in churches or Christian groups.</description></item><item><title>The General Roadmap of the Project</title><link>https://www.cantara.app/blog/2023-02-01-the-general-roadmap-of-the-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 16:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.cantara.app/blog/2023-02-01-the-general-roadmap-of-the-project/</guid><description>When I started Cantara six years ago (three years before I created this Github repository), I didn&amp;rsquo;t except that I would continue the project for such a long time. Originally only designed for my personal purpose (having a simple song presentation program for church groups) it is now a widely used Open Source project. According to the snap store statistics (which is the only reliable one I have at the moment), Cantara is currently used by more then 120 individuals from 39 countries around the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
