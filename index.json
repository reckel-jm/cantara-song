[{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/how-cantara-works/","title":"How Cantara Works","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Background Story When I was at my high school time, I became part in the leadership of a Christian youth group. When conducting our events, we liked to sing a few songs at the beginning. However the problem occurred that the available song books where not enough and the content was sometimes not matching with the songs which were wished. At that time I was looking for an available song presentation program and became disappointed quickly. Most of the existing programs were either commercial, very complicated or simply an \u0026ldquo;overkill\u0026rdquo; for the basically quite simple purpose: People should be able to (spontaneously) choosing songs, the program should then display them.\nAt that time, I decided to start the development of Cantara. The name is coming from the Latin \u0026ldquo;cantare\u0026rdquo; (to sing) but more artificial then real. An other reason for choosing the name was that at the same time, I was becoming an organ player in church â€“and the German name for that position is \u0026ldquo;Kantor\u0026rdquo; which sounds quite similar.\nLater I have been able to lead the best student group in the world ðŸ˜ƒ and while doing so, the program slowly was growing and updated with new futures like multi-screen-support and the opportunity to export song texts directly to the clipboard so that it can be used in small groups without beamer projection possibility. Cantara\u0026rsquo;s development will continue and I hope that it will be a small tool to praise and worship our great heavenly father!\nThe Approach graph LR; A[Song Rep] --\u003e|Collecting Songs| B(Song List) B --\u003e C(Song Selection) C --\u003e D{Generate Presentation Data} D --\u003e E[Run Presentation] D --\u003e F[Copy Lyrics to Clipboard] Cantara takes the songs from one particular folder on the file system which is called the song repository (or briefly song repo). Every song is a simple text file which can be edited with a text editor of your choice. Cantara will recognize the song title from the name of the file (without the extension). So, for example. If you have a file like:\nAmazing Grace.song Cantara will recognize it as \u0026ldquo;Amazing Grace\u0026rdquo; written in the song format (for formats see the next section).\nThe song repository dictionary can be shared and synced easily via cloud services like NextCloud or Git. In that way you can distribute songs within your group or organization.\nThe developers of Cantara are not responsible for copyright issues which come along with the public use and distributions of song lyrics. Make sure that you obtain the rights for using the song lyrics! In Germany, religious gatherings with free admission enjoy higher copyright freedom than commercial events. However, please make sure with your organization that no legal problems arise.\n"},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/contribute/translate/","title":"Translate","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Cantara can be easily translated to an other language. While doing so, you will help to spread the use of the software all over the world, so that also people who don\u0026rsquo;t speak English have access to Cantara.\nHow it works Cantara uses language files (*.mo-files) which contain the translated language strings in a binary language. This files can be created by using an editor like Poedit using the cantara.pot file as a template.\nIf you would like to do a translation into a new language, procedure in the following way:\nDownload cantara.pot and open it with an appropriate editor.\nTranslate the strings into the desired target language.\nExport the translated content as an .mo-file but also keep the translated .po file!\nCopy the language.mo file to \u0026lt;cantara-dir\u0026gt;/languages/language/cantara.mo (replace language with the shortcode of the language, e.g. de for German, en for English, zh for Chinese, etc.).\nTest your translation by running Cantara with the --lang option:\ncantara --lang=\u0026lt;language code\u0026gt;\nIf the translation works well, please make a pull request at GitHub so that others can make use of it as well.\nCurrent State Currently, Cantara is translated to the following languages:\nLanguage Completeness English 100 % German 100 % Chinese (traditional) 100 % "},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/releasenotes/","title":"Release Notes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This page contains information about the changes in different versions (releases) and plans for the future.\nReleases Version 2.3.2 (2022-11-10) This is a minor release which brings two small but useful improvements:\nCompletion of traditional Chinese translation readiness for Flatpak Check the corresponding GitHub page for details.\nVersion 2.3.1 (2022-08-12) This is a minor release and follow up on version 2.3\nImprovements Version 2.3.1 brings support for background images.

If you need further information, you can head to the tutorial section, too.\n"},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/install-cantara/","title":"Install Cantara","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Installing Cantara is quite simple if you are using Windows or Linux. It should also be no problem with Mac OS. Here you will find a detailed description for your operating system.\nWindows The installation using windows is very easy. There is an installer which you can use and which will lead you through the process. After downloading, the installation should take less than one minute.\nSimply download and run the installer, go through the questions and install Cantara. After the installation, you will find the program in your start menu. In addition, if you have chosen the option during the setup process, you will also have a shortcut on your desktop.\nLinux Cantara was developed by a Linux fan and enthusiast. So, it is my pleasure to make sure that Cantara is working well on every Linux distribution.\nCantara can use the QT5 and GTK2 librarys for the graphical user interface. Due to compatibility issues, I have switched to QT5 for the binary packages which means that if you are using a binary package of cantara, you will get a QT5 application. If you prefer GTK2, please compile cantara by yourself.\nArch Linux and Arch based distributions (Manjaro, Garuda, etc.) The Arch User Repository (AUR) The Arch User Repository (AUR) contains package built information which allows you to build software packages automatically and install them on your local file system. This is the prefered way for installation of software outside of the official repositories. There are two Cantara package builds in the AUR: Use cantara-bin for a pre-compiled version of Cantara and cantara if you would like the system to compile the package. Note that for the installation process of the second option, the compilers and libraries of Pascal and Lazarus have to get downloaded and installed which might require several hundred megabytes of disk space. You can delete these tools after the compilation process has been completed.\nThere are many ways how to install a package from the AUR. Most people might use a helper like yay. Just install one of the packages:\nyay cantara-bin # fast and compact installation of pre-compiled binary yay cantara # downloads source code and compile by yourself A big advantage of using a helper like yay is that it will also keep the packages up-to-date! Whenever a new version of Cantara gets released, you should be able to update it via sudo yay -Syu\nOnce installed, Cantara can be uninstalled via pacman: sudo pacman -R cantara.\nPre-Built Pacman Installation Package If you don\u0026rsquo;t like to use the AUR, you can also use the pre-built Pacman package from the Github repository. For downloading and installing the package, simply enter the following commands in the command line:\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/download/v2.3.2/cantara-2.3.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst sudo pacman -U cantara-2.3.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst Cantara is now installed and ready for use. If you later would like to uninstall it, you can use Pacman as well:\nsudo pacman -R cantara Ubuntu/Debian based Linux distributions There is a DEB-Package for 2.3 Beta which works well with Ubuntu. You can download it here and then open it with \u0026ldquo;Software Installation\u0026rdquo; or use dpkg in the command line:\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/download/v2.3/cantara-2.3.deb sudo dpkg -i cantara-2.3.deb If you would like to remove Cantara at a later point, you can use sudo apt-get remove cantara. In addition to that, you can get Cantara as a Snap via the Ubuntu Software Store.\nSnap Cantara is available at the Snap Store! The snap package now only takes 4.5 MB and is therefore a good distribution-independent way to install Cantara. You can follow the instructions on the Cantara store page to find out how to install it on your local system or - if snapd is already running - install it via the command line.\nsudo snap install cantara The way how a Snap application is running is different from a normal package. Therefore there might be some different behavior e.g. a different look of the program. In any case, feel free to report every unexpected behavior so that I can try to fix it.\nSnap will create a starter in the start menu. If you like to run Cantara via the command line, the command is snap run cantara.\nYou can also install different versions of Cantara at the same time and even install Cantara as a classical package and a snap together. Check the Snap Documentation for further details.\nFlatpak/Flathub Cantara has been packaged as a Flatpak as well and can be installed and updated from flathub.org. This requires an installed flatpak on your operation system. Some distribution like Fedora have this already out of the box, in other distributions like Arch Linux, you need to install it manually.\nInstalling a flatpak from flathub can be done via a graphical software management tool, for example Gnome Software or KDE Discover, or via the command line:\nflatpak install app.cantara.Cantara Depending on the flats you have already installed, flatpak might download several houndreds of megabytes for the required KDE/Qt-runtimes. That being said, although the actual Cantara flat is less then 4 MB installing Cantara via flatpak is for sure not the most disk space friendly way.\nGeneric Installation of Binaries Download the Zip-File from the Github Repository, extract it and run make install:\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/download/v2.3.2/cantara-2.3.2-linux-x86_64_bin.zip tar -zxvf cantara-2.3.2-linux-x86_64_bin.zip This will install Cantara globally on your system. You could also run Cantara directly from the dictionary without installing it. If you later want to uninstall a global installed Cantara, run the following commands:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/cantara sudo rm /usr/share/icons/cantara.png sudo xdg-desktop-menu uninstall reckel-cantara.desktop sudo rm /usr/share/locale/en/cantara.mo Generic Compilation Install lazarus and lazbuild from your local repository. If you prefer QT5, you could also install lazarus-qt instead of lazarus if the distribution provides a certain package. After you have done that, the compilation is quite easy: Download the source code, extract it and run lazbuild with the appropriate options.\nwget https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/archive/refs/tags/v2.3.1.tar.gz tar -zxvf v2.3.tar.gz cd v2.3 make If you prefer GTK2, change the option to --ws=gtk2 in the makefile. If done with no errors, you will find the executable binary cantara in the same folder.\nMac OS Thanks to Github\u0026rsquo;s setup-lazarus action, there are now also binarys for Mac OS X created by the Github Matrix virtual host. However I personally have no experience with Mac OS X because I don\u0026rsquo;t use it by myself. Nethertheless: Due to Lazarus\u0026rsquo; plattform-independency, it should be no problem to run it. You can try the following steps:\nDownload the MacOS X binary archive from the last artifact(Zip-File). Extract the zip file and run the .app-bundle. If you went through the steps, please tell me how it worked out! If these steps fail, you can also install the Lazarus IDE, open the project source code and compile Cantara by yourself.\n"},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/contribute/contributors/","title":"Contributors","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Cantara would not have been possible without the help of the following contributors (GitHub users in alphabetical order):\n@freundTech: helping with preparing the program for flatpak @primores-resugendi: Contributing traditional Chinese translation Thank you very much!\n"},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/how-to-use-it/","title":"How to use it","tags":[],"description":"","content":"First Steps After the installation, simply open Cantara with your start menu or the cantara command. You will then be asked to choose a directory for the song repository. Here you should choose a song repository directory where you all the song lyrics files are stored. If you have none yet, you can use the three points \u0026hellip; at the right size of the edit field to open a folder browser. There you can create or open an appropriate folder and save it as your repository path.\nYou can also adjust the font settings, the text color or the background color. The option Spoiler next Slide will show the lyrics of the next song part in smaller font size under the current part.\nBeside that, you can configure how the Meta Data of songs should be displayed. See more details in the section Meta Data.\nThe Song Selection Window If the configuration has been done successfully, you will come to the song selection window where you can choose the songs which you would like to sing. The search field may help you to find the one you like. Simply double-click or press enter after the selection of the song in the left list, and the song will go to the right list where you can adjust the order or remove the selected songs. After you are done, press the Presentation button to start the presentation. You can also press CTRL+P instead.\nCantara will automatically detect at start whether you have connected a second monitor (like a second screen or a beamer) to your PC. If so, it will select the two-windows-mode automatically. You can also adjust this as you want.\nDuring the Presentation Mode During the presentation mode, you can control the presentation slides via several ways:\nUsing the arrow keys: You can use the arrow keys of your keyboard to go forward or backward Using the Enter or Space key: You can use Enter or Space for moving a slide forward Pressing ESC: will end the presentation Mouse Click: Will move a slide forward Clicking at a song at the right selection list in the song selection window (multi screen-mode only): You can directly jump to a certain song If you are running other programs like Libreoffice Impress or MS PowerPoint in presentation mode at the same time, you can easily switch between the presenters with Alt+Tab. When the presentation mode in Cantara gets started, it will cover the second screen and be in foreground. To move Cantara to the background, press Alt+Tab to navigate to the program you want to show up.\nSave and Load Song Selections You can save and load song selections into Cantara to share it within the organization or for preparing an event. In order to be able to load a song selection, the songs have to be available in the local song repository as well.\n"},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Tutorial The following pages will give you a detailed instruction to Cantara and how the software works.

Depending on the song format, Cantara will get the following meta data.\nCCLI Songselect Following data will be collected from each CCLI songselect lyrics file:\nauthor: The name(s) of all author(s) separated by a \u0026lsquo;|\u0026rsquo;. ccli-licensenumber: The number of the CCLI license which is dependent on the user account (not on the song) ccli-songnumber: The CCLI number on the song which is dependent on the song. Song format In the song format, meta data can be specified by a line with a # at the beginning. For example:\n#author: John Newton #title: Amazing Grace Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once wast lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I'm free!

Cantara supports two different song formats. One has the file ending .song and is very simple for it just contains the lyrics in the order as they should be presented. The other format is used by CCLI Songselect and has the file endings .txt or .ccli. CCLI is a commercial database where you can download a lot of Christian songs for the use in churches or Christian groups.\nA lot of Christian church denominations and groups in Germany (including FeG, SMD as far as I know) provide member access to CCLI Songselect. You can find out whether you organization has already booked a subscription for you.\nCantara will automatically detect the correct song format and interpretate it in the way as stated below.\nThe song file format The song file format is a file which ends with .song. The lyrics there have to be printed in the same order as they should be shown including repetitions. Different slides are seperated with a double linebreak (an empty line). For example, if you would like to add the song \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus\u0026rdquo;, add a new file 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.song with the following content:\nExpand the file content 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus Just to take Him at His word Just to rest upon His promise Just to know thus saith the Lord Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more O how sweet to trust in Jesus Just to trust His cleansing blood Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing cleansing flood Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus Just from sin and self to cease Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest and joy and peace Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee Precious Jesus Savior Friend And I know that Thou art with me Wilt be with me to the end Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more The song consists of four stanzas with the chorus repeated after each one. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s say that we would like to have a slightly different version of the song where we sing two stanzas together. A good convention fot this would be to copy the existing file 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.song to 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus [two stanzas together].song and adjust the content:\nExpand the file content 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus Just to take Him at His word Just to rest upon His promise Just to know thus saith the Lord O how sweet to trust in Jesus Just to trust His cleansing blood Just in simple faith to plunge me 'Neath the healing cleansing flood Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus Just from sin and self to cease Just from Jesus simply taking Life and rest and joy and peace I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee Precious Jesus Savior Friend And I know that Thou art with me Wilt be with me to the end Jesus Jesus how I trust Him How I've proved Him o'er and o'er Jesus Jesus precious Jesus O for grace to trust Him more Cantara will detect both song files and list them next to each other. While this approach seems to be a little bit complecated at the beginning, the practical usage has shown that it is much easier then using more complex file formats. You can always use your local text editor to adjust the lyrics as you like them to be. There will be no danger of missinterpretation or wrong order.\nCCLI Songselect As stated above, you can directly import songs from CCLI Songselect. Go to their webpage, login with your account and search for the song which you want to download. Press the speech bubble symbol right next to it (see picture below). After the text is shown, click at the third blue button from the left with the download symbol. Save the .txt-file directly into the Cantara song repository directory. Cantara should recognize the song and use the lyrics in the correct order.\nHow Cantara understands the CCLI song lyrics files In opposite to the song format, the CCLI songselect lyrics format provides no information about the correct order of the different parts (stanzas/chorusses etc.). So, Cantara has to determine the order via an implemented algorithm. For most of the songs, Cantara will put the lyrics into the correct order. However, some of the CCLI song files lack consistency. In this case, you should create a .song-file on your own. Here is some information about the parts which Cantara does understand:\n\u0026ldquo;Vers/Strophe\u0026rdquo;: a stanza which will be sung only once at the placed position \u0026ldquo;Chorus\u0026rdquo;: if available, the chorus will be sung at the placed position and afterwards repeated after every stanza or bridge. If an other chorus will come, it will replace the first one. \u0026ldquo;Bridge\u0026rdquo;: Will be treated like a stanza. A chorus will (most likely) follow if there has been one before. \u0026ldquo;PreChorus\u0026rdquo;: Will be sung before chorus (here the format is quite inconsistent!) \u0026ldquo;Schluss\u0026rdquo;: A closing part of the song. No chorus will follow. In the future, there will be an implementation of a direct conversion tool from the CCLI song format to the song format.\nAs stated before, it is your responsability to comply with the legal requirements of CCLI and the song copyright owners when using their services!\nAdditional Song Lyrics Sources Hymnary.org: A very large hymn collection (mostly English) Evangeliums.net: A German collection of Christian songs, some can not be accessed directly due to copyright restrictions The Cantara SongRepo at Github: Contains Public Domain Songs for free and direct use "},{"uri":"https://www.cantara.app/imprint/","title":"Imprint and Data Privacy","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Imprint This site is run by:\nJan Martin Reckel\nUlbrichtstraÃŸe 7\n09126 Chemnitz\nUse GitHub for any software related contact request.\nThe content of this webpage is provided as it is without any warranty or assurance that the information might be correct.
